      <p class="lead" style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
        The Treaty of Waitangi is the founding document of New Zealand. It is an agreement entered into by representatives of the
        Crown and of Māori iwi (tribes) and hapū (sub-tribes). It is named after the place in the Bay of Islands where the
        Treaty was first signed, on 6 February 1840. The Treaty was not drafted as a constitution or a statute. It was a broad
        statement of principles upon which the British officials and Māori chiefs made a political compact or covenant to found
        a nation state and build a government in New Zealand to deal with pressing new circumstances. Like many treaties, it
        is an exchange of promises between the parties to it.</p>

            <p style="font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;font-size:1.2em;width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
                Since 1840 governments have taken actions that have resulted in the alienation of Māori land, waters and other resources
                from their owners, generally without proper consent or compensation. Māori have tried to have their grievances addressed,
                and some early governments attempted to settle their claims. Only some of those claims were addressed, and these attempts
                are now considered to have been inadequate. Recent governments have recognised that the way some land transactions
                took place was unjust and left a strong sense of grievance with the original owners and their descendants. In 1975
                the Waitangi Tribunal was established to consider claims by Māori against the Crown regarding breaches of principles
                of the Treaty and to make recommendations to government to remove the prejudice and provide recompense. Since 1985
                the tribunal has been able to consider Crown acts and omissions dating back to 1840. This has provided Māori with an
                important means to have their grievances against the actions of past governments investigated.</p>
